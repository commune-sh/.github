Commune is an open source community platform, specifically designed for public-by-default communities. We serve projects that benefit from working in the open, perpetually improved by their wisdom of the crowd.

Built as a Matrix server extension (Synapse only for now) combined with a custom client to make use of said extensions, Commune inverts some major norms of the mainstream Matrix experience:

1. Web-readable channels and threads that are easily shared as links and tended to in a [digital garden](https://github.com/commune-os/commune-server/discussions/28).
2. Shared interest discoverability across spaces via [federated webrings](https://blog.commune.sh/federated-webrings/).
3. [Opt-in everything](https://github.com/commune-os/commune-server/discussions/31) (encryption, federation, notifications et.al.) for ease of onboarding. Our top priority is getting people into a shared space together with minimal friction.
4. Baked in [Discord-interop](https://github.com/commune-os/commune-server/discussions/27) for easy onboarding of non-Matrix users.

With the Matrix protocol as a stable backbone, Commune acts as an accessibility layer on top that optimizes for online community building by small and medium sized grassroots organisations, as opposed to the 'secure & private' focus of [Element](https://element.io/) which targets governments and enterprises.

See this [comparison](https://github.com/commune-os/commune-server/discussions/23) for a better idea of how Commune compares to other chat/forum apps.
